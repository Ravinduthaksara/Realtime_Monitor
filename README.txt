Hello In this Project I included an arduino code for build 
Realtime Temperature & Humidity monitoring system using NodeMcu 
development board and DHT11 sensor.

To get the values from sensors and display it I using Blynk App
It has beautiful UI for better user interaction.

hope it will be usefull for some IoT related Projects 

Thankyou.
